# Interplay - Play Build plugins

Interplay is a set of sbt plugins for Play builds, sharing common configuration between Play builds so that they can be configured in one place.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/playframework/interplay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/playframework/interplay)

## Usage

Ensure you're using sbt 0.13.15, by setting `sbt.version` in `project/build.properties`.

Add the interplay plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "interplay" % sys.props.get("interplay.version").getOrElse("2.1.2"))
```

By allowing the version to be overridden using system properties, this means the Play nightly builds can override it to use the latest version.

Now which plugins you enable and what configuration you set depends on the structure of your build.  In all cases, you should set `playBuildRepoName in ThisBuild` to be the name of the GitHub repository in the `playframework` organisation that the project lives in.

### Play libraries

If your project is a simple library that gets used in a Play application then enable the `PlayLibrary` plugin on it.

### SBT plugins

If your project is an sbt plugin, then enable the `PlaySbtPlugin` plugin on it.  In addition to this, on the root project, you should also configure the scripted task as an extra test, for example:

```scala
lazy val `my-sbt-plugin` := project in file(".")

playBuildExtraTests := {
  (scripted in `my-sbt-plugin`).toTask("").value
}
```

### SBT libraries

If your project is not an sbt plugin, but does get used by sbt, then enable the `PlaySbtLibrary` plugin on it.

### The root project

If your root project is also a Play library or SBT Plugin, then you should enable the `PlayReleaseBase` plugin in addition to the other plugin.

If you have a root project that is just a meta project that aggregates all your projects together, but itself shouldn't be published, then enable the `PlayRootProject` plugin on it.

### Aggregating projects

In general, your root project should aggregate all the projects you want to publish.  If it aggregates projects that you don't want to publish, you can make them not published by enabling the `PlayNoPublish` plugin.

In some cases, it's not possible to aggregate all the projects you want to publish, for example, if your project contains both sbt plugins and Play libraries, aggregating the sbt plugins would cause problems with cross building because sbt plugins don't get cross built.  In this case, you need to manually aggregate the `publishSigned` task, by adding it to `playBuildExtraPublish`:

```scala
playBuildExtraPublish := {
  (publishSigned in `my-sbt-plugin`).value
}
```

### Play docs

If your project includes documentation that you want included in the main Play documentation, you can allow this by adding the `Playdoc` plugin to it.  In that case you also will need to configure the `playdocDirectory` to point to the documentation directory.

## Whitesource integration

Interplay has a `PlayWhitesourcePlugin` which can be used to help the integration with [sbt-whitesource](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbt-whitesource). To use it, add the following to your root project:

```scala
lazy val PlayFramework = Project("Play-Framework", file("."))
    .enablePlugins(PlayRootProject)
    .enablePlugins(PlayWhitesourcePlugin)
    .settings(
      whitesourceAggregateProjectName := "name-of-the-project", // project name on Whitesource
      whitesourceAggregateProjectToken := "389ebacb-..." // project token on Whitesource
    )
```

After that, you can run sbt [sbt-whitesource](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbt-whitesource) tasks:

```bash
sbt whitesourceCheckPolicies
sbt whitesourceUpdate
```
